## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Another project using Talwind CSS. For this one, I learned about using .target in my JavaScript to be able to create a variable that keeps track of which button was clicked. I also made the code in a way the only one of the arrows can be clicked at a certain time. The clicked arrow becomes light gray and no longer has cursor:pointer, to show the moment it becomes unavailable. Feedback is welcome!
